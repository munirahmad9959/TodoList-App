# Todo List Application

## Project Description

This project is a simple yet powerful Todo List application built using React and Vite. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The application leverages localStorage to persist data, ensuring that the tasks remain intact even after a page refresh. The user interface is styled with Tailwind CSS and includes some custom styles.
